# Hello World in AWS

## Requirements:

- AWS credentials (talk to Lambda if you need some)
- An AWS env with running network, security, and deployment cluster stacks

## Steps:

1. Make a docker image that responds to all requests with "hello world"

       $ docker build -t 114272735376.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world .

2. Push the image to AWS EC2 Container Registry

       $ `aws ecr get-login`
       $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name hello-world
       $ docker push 114272735376.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello-world

3. Launch!

       $ ./deploy/launch-hello-world lab
